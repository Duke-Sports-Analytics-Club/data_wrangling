# Data Wrangling


This is the 2nd installment of Duke Sports Analytics Mini Course in R.
In this workshop, we are going to be doing a deep dive into data wrangling. 

Often times, especially with sports data, data cleaning and wrangling is going 
to be 50% of the work already. Learning how to efficiently clean and move data 
around is going to be essential for any data scientist and sports analyst. 

## Loading Data

Loading in data is going to be essential to any project. Last time we used data
from packages we loaded in. This time, we will want to use outside data. 
Data is provided in the folder in the repository. 

The data we will be working with comes from basketball-reference.com, an open source NBA data website. We will
specifically be using 2021-2022 NBA player data. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html

A description of each column header representing the stat can also be found at the link above by
hovering over the desired text. 

## Working with dplyr

dplyr is a key data wrangling package that we will learn to use and apply. 

Highly recommend reading from the official website to get a clearer picture of how each function works.

The below books are also great resources. R Cookbook is for beginners, while
R for Data Science does require some basic knowledge of R.
