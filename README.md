# data_wrangling


This is the 2nd installment of Duke Sports Analytics Mini Course in R.
In this workshop, we are going to be doing a deep dive into data wrangling. 

Often times, especially with sports data, data cleaning and wrangling is going 
to be 50% of the work already. Learning how to efficiently clean and move data 
around is going to be essential for any data scientist and sports analyst.
