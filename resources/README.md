# Resources | Data Wrangling Workshop

All resources are linked below as supplemental material to help you understand data wrangling.


## Readings

dplyr is a key data wrangling package that we will learn to use and apply. 

Highly recommend reading from the official website to get a clearer picture of how each function works.

Some of the other resources include more advanced data manipulation techniques we did not 
cover in class.
